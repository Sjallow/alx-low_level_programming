What is a search algorithm?
A search algorithm is a method for finding an item or group of items in a collection of data. The data may be stored in a variety of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs. There are different types of search algorithms, but they all have the same goal: to locate the item(s) that match a particular search criteria.

What is a linear search?
A linear search, also known as a sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that checks each item in a collection of data one by one until it finds the item it is looking for. It starts at the beginning of the data structure and moves sequentially through each item until it reaches the end of the structure or finds the target item.

The linear search algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of items in the collection. This means that as the number of items increases, the time it takes to find the target item also increases linearly.
